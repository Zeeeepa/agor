## What Is Agor?

**Agor is an agent orchestrator** - the platform layer that sits above all agentic coding tools, providing one UI to manage all agents.

**Pronunciation:** "AY-gore"

**Tagline:**

> **Next-gen agent orchestration for AI-assisted development.**
> The multiplayer, spatial layer that connects Claude Code, Codex, Gemini, and any agentic coding tool into one unified workspace.

## The Vision

A platform for **real-time, multiplayer agentic development**.
Visualize, coordinate, and automate your AI workflows across tools.
Agor turns every AI session into a composable, inspectable, and reusable building block.

Build the orchestration layer for AI-assisted development. Instead of competing with agentic coding tools (Claude Code, Cursor, Codex, Gemini), Agor provides the coordination and visibility layer above them all.

### The Core Insight

> **Context engineering isn't about prompt templates—it's about managing sessions, tasks, and concepts as first-class composable primitives stored in a session tree.**

### What Makes Agor Different

- **Agent Orchestration Layer** - Integrates with Claude Code, Codex, and soon Gemini, via an extensible SDK. Centralized MCP configuration—connect once, use across all tools.
- **Multiplayer Spatial Canvas** - Real-time collaboration with cursor broadcasting and facepiles. Sessions live on a dynamic board—cluster by project, phase, or purpose.
- **Context-Aware Development** - Manage deliberate context via `context/` folder of markdown files. Dynamically load modular context blocks per session.
- **Native Session Forking & Subtask Forcing** - Fork any session to explore alternatives. Spawn subtasks with fresh context windows. Full introspection and genealogy tracking.
- **Zone Triggers — Workflows Made Spatial** - Define zones on your board that trigger templated prompts when sessions are dropped. Build kanban-style flows or custom pipelines.
- **Git Worktree Management + Environments** - Every session maps to an isolated git worktree—no branch conflicts. Optionally spin up dev environments per worktree with automatic port management and health monitoring. Run multiple feature branches in parallel with their own running apps.
- **Real-Time Strategy for AI Teams** - Coordinate agentic work like a multiplayer RTS. Watch teammates or agents move across tasks live.

## The Five Primitives

Everything in Agor is built from five fundamental primitives:

### 1. Session - The Universal Container

**Everything is a session.** A session represents an active conversation with an agentic coding tool.

```python
Session:
  session_id: str
  agent: str                    # "claude-code", "cursor", "codex", "gemini"
  git_ref: str                  # Git SHA at session start
  worktree_path: str | None     # Optional isolated workspace
  concepts: list[str]           # Loaded context modules
  tasks: list[str]              # Ordered task IDs

  # Genealogy
  forked_from_session_id: str | None    # Divergent path
  parent_session_id: str | None         # Spawned subtask
```

**Two Relationship Types:**

- **Fork** - Divergent exploration, inherits full history

  ```
  Session A: "Try REST API"
  └─ Session B (fork): "Try GraphQL instead"
  ```

- **Spawn** - New context window, delegated subtask
  ```
  Session A: "Build auth system"
  └─ Session C (spawn): "Design DB schema"
  ```

### 2. Task - User Prompts as Checkpoints

**Every user prompt creates a task.** Tasks are contiguous message ranges within a session.

```python
Task:
  task_id: str
  session_id: str
  description: str              # User's prompt/goal
  message_range: [int, int]     # [start, end] indices
  git_sha: str                  # "a4f2e91" or "a4f2e91-dirty"
  model: str                    # Can change mid-session
  report_template: str | None   # Post-task report type
  status: "created" | "running" | "completed" | "failed"
```

**Git State Tracking:**

```
Task 1: "Implement auth"
├─ Start: a4f2e91 (clean)
├─ Agent makes changes → a4f2e91-dirty
└─ Complete: b3e4d12
```

### 3. Report - Structured Learning Capture

**Post-task hooks generate reports.** After each task completes, Agor automatically extracts learnings using customizable templates.

**Example Templates:**

- `task-summary.md` - Generic fallback
- `bug-fix.md` - Root cause analysis
- `feature.yaml` - Structured feature documentation
- `research.md` - Investigation findings

**Generation Process:**

1. Task completes
2. Agor forks session ephemerally
3. Adds report generation prompt with template
4. Agent produces structured report
5. Report saved, ephemeral session discarded

### 4. Worktree - Isolated Git Workspaces + Environments

**Agor manages git worktrees with optional environments** for session isolation.

```
Main worktree: ~/my-project (main branch)
Session A → ~/my-project-auth (feature/auth) + docker compose environment
Session B → ~/my-project-graphql (feature/graphql) + isolated dev server
```

**Git Isolation Benefits:**

- Parallel sessions don't interfere
- Clean separation of experimental work
- Agents work in isolation
- Easy cleanup (delete worktree = delete experiment)

**Environment Management (Optional):**

Agor can spin up and manage development environments for each worktree via the **UI** (or CLI):

**Configuration via UI:**

In the Repositories settings panel, configure environment controls for any repo:

- **Start command:** `docker compose up -d` (or `npm run dev`, `./manage.py runserver`, etc.)
- **Stop command:** `docker compose down` (or any cleanup command)
- **Health endpoint:** `http://localhost:{{PORT}}/health` (checks if app is running)
- **URL template:** `http://localhost:{{PORT}}` (launches the running app)
- **Port offset:** 1000 (base port + 1000 × worktree index)

**What This Enables:**

- **Multi-worktree apps running in parallel** - Test feature/auth on :4000 while feature/graphql runs on :5000
- **Environment status monitoring** - Agor pings health endpoints, shows running/stopped state in UI
- **One-click start/stop** - Control buttons in WorktreesTable for each worktree
- **One-click access** - "Open App" button launches the running environment in browser
- **Automatic port management** - Each worktree gets unique ports, no conflicts
- **Shared across sessions** - Multiple sessions on same worktree share the environment

**Example: React App with Backend**

```
Worktree 1: feature/auth
├─ Environment: Running ✅
├─ Ports: 4000-4001
├─ URL: http://localhost:4000
└─ Sessions: 2 (Claude + Codex both testing auth)

Worktree 2: feature/payments
├─ Environment: Stopped 🔴
├─ Ports: 5000-5001
├─ URL: http://localhost:5000
└─ Sessions: 1 (Gemini implementing Stripe)
```

**Lightweight, No Lock-in:**

- Configure once in UI, works for all worktrees
- Uses your existing docker-compose.yml (or any command)
- Agor just manages start/stop/status via shell commands
- Works with any stack (Django, Rails, Next.js, Laravel, etc.)
- Stop environment → resources freed immediately
- Delete worktree → environment auto-cleaned up

### 5. Concept - Modular Context Nuggets

**Concepts are self-referencing knowledge modules** stored as Markdown files.

```
context/
├── auth.md
├── security.md
├── database.md
├── api-design.md
└── testing.md
```

**Features:**

- Wiki-style cross-references: `[[security]]`, `[[database]]`
- Composable (load only what's needed)
- Version-controlled evolution
- Team-shared knowledge base

**Loading Concepts:**

```bash
# Explicit loading
agor session start --concepts auth,security,api-design

# Recursive loading (follows references)
agor session start --concepts auth --recursive

# Dynamic task-level loading
agor task start --add-concepts database
```

## The Session Tree

**The session tree is Agor's fundamental artifact** - a complete, versioned record of all agentic coding sessions in your project.

### What It Stores

- **All sessions** - Every conversation with every agent
- **Complete genealogy** - Fork and spawn relationships
- **Git integration** - Which sessions produced which code
- **Task history** - Granular checkpoint of every user prompt
- **Reports** - Structured learnings extracted from each task
- **Concepts** - Modular context library used across sessions

### Why It Matters

**Observable:**

- Visualize entire tree of explorations
- See which paths succeeded, which failed
- Understand decision points and branches

**Interactive:**

- Manage multiple sessions in parallel
- Fork any session at any task
- Navigate between related sessions

**Shareable:**

- Push/pull like git (federated)
- Learn from others' successful patterns

**Versioned:**

- Track evolution over time
- Audit trail of AI-assisted development

### Session Tree As Git's Companion

```
Your Project:
├── .git/          # Code repository (git)
│   └── Your code's version history
│
└── .agor/         # Session tree (agor)
    ├── sessions/  # Conversation history
    ├── concepts/  # Context library
    └── Metadata linking sessions ↔ code
```

**Git tracks code. Agor tracks the conversations that produced the code.**

## How The Primitives Compose

### Example: Building Authentication Feature

**Phase 1: Main Session**

```bash
agor session start \
  --agent claude-code \
  --concepts auth,security,api-design \
  --worktree feature-auth
```

- Session A created with context loaded
- Worktree `../my-project-auth` created
- Task 1: Design JWT flow → Report generated
- Task 2: Implement endpoints → Report generated

**Phase 2: Fork for Alternative**

```bash
agor session fork <session-a> --from-task 1
```

- Session B created (forked from design phase)
- Task 3: Implement OAuth instead → Different approach, same context

**Phase 3: Spawn for Subtask**

```bash
agor session spawn <session-a> \
  --agent gemini \
  --concepts database,security
```

- Session C created (child of A)
- Task 4: Design user table → Focused DB work, no API context

**Result: Session Tree**

```
Session A (Claude Code, feature-auth worktree)
│ Concepts: [auth, security, api-design]
│
├─ Task 1: "Design JWT auth" ✓
├─ Task 2: "Implement JWT" ✓
│
├─ Session B (fork from Task 1)
│   └─ Task 3: "Implement OAuth" ✓
│
└─ Session C (spawn from Task 2, Gemini)
    └─ Task 4: "Design user table" ✓
```

## Key Design Principles

1. **Everything Is A Session** - Universal abstraction across all agents
2. **Tasks Are Checkpoints** - Granular, forkable, reportable
3. **Reports Are First-Class** - Automatic knowledge capture
4. **Worktrees Enable Parallelism** - Session isolation, no conflicts
5. **Concepts Are Modular** - Composable context, not monolithic files
